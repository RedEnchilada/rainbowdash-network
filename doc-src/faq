These are some *Frequently Asked Questions* about this service, with
some answers.

Using the site
--------------

### How do I reply to/favorite a post?/What are those black bars in other people's posts? ###

In the bottom-right corner of every post is a set of buttons allowing various operations to be performed 
on each post. Here is a list of each button, from left to right, as well as the function each is used for.

<a style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 14px">&#xf084;</a> **Decode spoilers**  
Toggles the appearance of the black bars, or spoilers, in notices, to show what is hidden in them. If there are 
no spoilers in a notice, this button runs the entire notice text through an [ROT13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) 
filter, which is useful for decoding spoilers in old notices made before the spoiler tags existed.

<a style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 14px">&#xf004;</a> **Favorite this notice**  
Adds the notice to your list of favorite notices. This also sends an e-mail to the author of the notice, if they 
have the option enabled. Notices that acquire a lot of favorites in a short time go to the Popular Notices section 
of the public timeline.

<a style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px;display: inline-block;margin-left: 4px;transform:rotate(90deg);-moz-transform:rotate(90deg);-webkit-transform:rotate(90deg);-o-transform:rotate(90deg);-ms-transform:rotate(90deg)">&#xf149;</a> **Reply to this notice**  
Begins a reply to the notice in question. Replies are linked back to their parent notice, and allow other users to 
browse the conversation easily at a later date.

<a style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 14px">&#xf079;</a> **Repeat this notice** (only appears on other users' public notices)  
Reposts the notice, with attribution, to your profile. This also brings the entire conversation to the top of any timeline in 
which it, as well as your notices, appears. For users who have threaded timelines [disabled](%%action.oldschoolsettings%%), it will duplicate 
the original notice to any timeline in which your posts appear.

<a style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 14px">&#xf014;</a> **Delete this notice** (only appears on your notices)  
Removes the notice from the site. Deleting a notice cannot be undone.

### What are those buttons along the top of the page for? ###

Those allow you to access various useful pages around the site. In order, from left to right:

<span style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px">&#xf015;</span> **Personal timeline**  
Your own personal timeline, comprised of people and tags you've subscribed to, groups you are a member of, and conversations you participate in.

<span style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px">&#xf06e;</span> **Watched**  
Drops down to a list of everything you follow: groups, lists, searches, and tags.

<span style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px">&#xf112;</span> **Replies**  
A list of replies by other users made to notices you've posted. Handy for keeping up with responses if your personal timeline is busy.

<span style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px">&#xf0e0;</span> **Private inbox**  
Your inbox, where you can receive and send private messages with people you have mutually subscribed to, as well as site staff.

<span style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px">&#xf013;</span> **Account settings**  
Allows you to adjust various settings that affect how you use the site. This is also the place to go to customize your profile.

<span style="font-family: FontAwesome;font-size: 16px">&#xf011;</span> **Logout**  
Logs you out of the site.

### I don't like this whole "threaded replies" thing. How do I change it? ###

If you'd like notices to be displayed in a more linear fashion (where replies show up as their own posts, rather than being attached to the original posts), 
the [Old-school settings page](%%action.oldschoolsettings%%) allows you to toggle that behavior. You can also switch conversation pages from a 
linear set of replies to a threaded system, which nests replies within their parent posts, there.

### How do I find a member of site staff? How can I tell if someone is a staff member? ###

The [Staff page](%%action.staff%%) has an up-to-date listing of staff members who enforce rules and maintain the site.
There is no other external indicator that someone is a staff member. 

The technical stuff
-------------------

### What is %%site.name%%? ###

%%site.name%% is a stream oriented social network service.

You can use it to write short notices about yourself, where you are,
and what you're doing, and those notices will be sent to all your friends
and fans.

You can also post event invitations, bookmarks, polls, and questions or
other kinds of social broadcasts.

### How is %%site.name%% different from Twitter? ###

Like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/), %%site.name%% is a light service
with a stream-oriented interface. It uses @-replies, hashtags,
provides search, and has private messages. It provides an API, and can
be integrated with SMS systems. You can create lists.

Unlike Twitter, %%site.name%% allows more data than just plain text
and links to travel across the network. You can install the StatusNet
software that runs %%site.name%% on your own servers, since it's Free
and Open Source software. You can make groups, and share privately
with those groups.

You can make your site available only to people you choose. You can
customize it with your own themes and plugins, or download plugins
from the StatusNet site.

### How is %%site.name%% different from Yammer, SocialCast, or Salesforce Chatter? ###

Like some enterprise social software services, StatusNet lets you
share privately with other people in your company. You can use
microapps to post richer kinds of data, use public and private groups
to share with team members, use extended profiles to show more about
yourself and your company, and review groups and users in a directory.

Unlike those other services, StatusNet is free and open source
software. You can install it on your own servers. You can customize
the theme and add plugins.
